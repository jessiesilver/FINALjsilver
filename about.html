<h2>About this project</h2>
<br>
<br>
<p>
  Six months ago, I stepped inside a jail for the first time in my life.
  <br> I was there to help with a project, for which I had to interview people who were being detained at the jail -
  <br> "inmates" or "bodies" as the Corrections Officers call them.
  <br>
  <br>I still struggle to find the right words to describe all my thoughts and feelings that first day.
  <br>Astonishment that such a reality existed, shock at some of the norms of the environment, humility from learning of so many peoples struggles to stay out of jail...
  <br>
<br>Since that time, I've been back often. I've become accomstomed to the context, the cacauphony, the gumtion, the suffering.
<br>
<br>But, I've not become accepting of it.
<br>
<br> This experience has led me to inquiriy - how do other nations handle the concept of incarceration?
<br>
<br>This project is a showcase of some of that inquiry. I hope that is intriguing for the viewer, and informative. If nothing else, it serves to remind those of us who might be completely unware that millions of people are behind bars.
<br>
<br>Is it doing them any good?
<br>
 <br>Is it doing the rest of us any good?
 <br>
 <br>I have ideas about this, and clearly observe correaltions in the data that I present here.
 <br>However, instead of dogma, I'd like this information to speak for itself, and let the viewer form their own questions, or draw there own conclusions.
